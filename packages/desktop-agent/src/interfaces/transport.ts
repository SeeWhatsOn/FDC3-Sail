/**
 * Transport Interface
 *
 * Abstraction for bidirectional message transport to/from the Desktop Agent.
 *
 * **Key Concept**: Transport represents "WHERE is the Desktop Agent" - it is
 * ONE pipe to the Desktop Agent location (server, browser, worker), NOT a
 * per-app connection.
 *
 * Message routing to specific apps happens via `instanceId` embedded in DACP
 * message metadata (message.meta.source.instanceId, message.meta.destination.instanceId),
 * not at the transport layer.
 *
 * Implementations handle environment-specific details:
 * - Socket.IO (server-based Desktop Agent)
 * - MessagePort (worker or browser-based Desktop Agent)
 * - IPC (Electron/native Desktop Agent)
 * - In-memory (Desktop Agent in same process)

 * Transport interface for sending and receiving DACP messages.

 * **Important**: This is ONE transport for the entire Desktop Agent, not
 * per-app. Message routing to specific apps is handled by:
 * 1. ConnectionManager (browser) - routes via MessagePort map
 * 2. Desktop Agent - reads instanceId from message.meta.destination
